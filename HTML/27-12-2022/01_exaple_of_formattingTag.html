      Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of <b><i>SGML</i></b
      >. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
      <a href="">(IETF)</a> with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal
      for an HTML specification, the
      <ins>"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"</ins> Internet Draft by
      Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type
      definition to define the grammar. <a href=""><sup>[9][10]</sup></a> The
      draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of
      the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
      reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful
      prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft,
      "<code>HTML</code>+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
      standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out
      forms.&trade;
